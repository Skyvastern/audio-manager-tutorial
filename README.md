### Note
In the project, if you're wondering why I didn't make use of TileMap to build out the ground, then the reason is that the edges of the scribble ground textures are squiggly and gets clipped with rectangular boundary of the tile. So the result doesn't look very good. Maybe there's a way to resolve this, but I didn't put much effort into figuring that out, since this project's primary aim was to demonstrate the usage of Audio Manager. In case, you know the solution to the TileMap issue or any other kind of improvement in the project, you are free to make a PR of it, and upon reviewing it I will merge that into the master branch.
